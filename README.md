In the first folder Esercizio1 there is a Jupyter notebook file, and the other folder of each subexercise; The results of the exercise are already there, the Jupyter notebook will read the data files in each subexercise, so before try to compilate and run again the exercise first run the Jupyter and watch the results. If now you want to try the code then you have to delete the old .dat file and then compile and run it. Otherwise the .dat file will overlapping the datas (make clean does not remove .dat files)\
For other exercise is much easier, the files will generate in the subfolder for each subexercise; then you will copy and paste inside the folder with the Jupyter notebook. Even in the next exercise you have to delete the .dat files inside the subexercise folder before run the code again.
In folder Esercizio6 the solution are separate because i needed to plot the total function of 1D Ising model for many temperature. The Esercizio10 must be compiled by loading a module: module load mpi/mpich-x86_64, make and then mpiexec -np 4 ./main.exe (only 4). In the folder Esercizio11 and Esercizio12 there are the not tried Jupyter notebook. I also (in case) added the .py files for each exercise.
